AI-CareerAssist
AI-Based Resume Analysis, Job Matching and Career Recommendation System
AI-CareerAssist is an AI/ML-based career assistance system that analyzes a user's resume and provides personalized career-related insights.

The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF feature extraction, cosine similarity, and Logistic Regression to analyze resume information and generate job, skill, career, and learning recommendations.

📌 Problem Statement
Students and job seekers often face difficulty in understanding:

Which jobs are suitable for their current skills
Which skills are missing from their resume
Which career categories match their profile
What skills they should learn next
AI-CareerAssist addresses these problems by analyzing resume content and providing automated career-related recommendations through an interactive Streamlit application.

🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of AI-CareerAssist are:

To extract useful information from a resume.
To preprocess and clean resume text.
To convert resume text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
To identify the most suitable job based on resume-job similarity.
To identify matched and missing skills.
To predict suitable career categories using Machine Learning.
To recommend learning resources for missing skills.
To evaluate the career classification model.
To provide all results through an easy-to-use web interface.
🚀 Features
1. Resume Upload
Users can upload their resume in:

PDF format
TXT format
The system extracts readable text from the uploaded resume.

2. Resume Text Preprocessing
The extracted resume text is cleaned before analysis.

The preprocessing stage prepares the text for feature extraction and machine learning.

3. TF-IDF Feature Extraction
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert text into numerical feature vectors.

These vectors are used for comparing resume content with job information.

4. Job Matching
The system compares the uploaded resume with available job descriptions using cosine similarity.

The system displays:

Best matching job
Match score
Experience level
Required skills
5. Skill Gap Analysis
The system identifies:

Skills already present in the resume
Skills required for the matched job
Missing skills
This helps users understand which skills they need to develop.

6. Career Classification
A Logistic Regression model is used to classify the resume into suitable career categories.

The system displays the top career predictions with their confidence values.

7. Learning Recommendations
Learning recommendations are generated based on the missing skills.

Examples include:

Python
Machine Learning
SQL
Data Analysis
Deep Learning
Git
GitHub
Cloud Computing
Docker
8. Model Evaluation
The career classification model is evaluated using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix

📊 Machine Learning Approach
Job Matching

Resume and job information are converted into TF-IDF vectors.

Cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity between the resume and available jobs.

A higher similarity score indicates greater textual similarity between the resume and the job information.

Career Classification

The career classification module uses:

TF-IDF Features
       ↓
Logistic Regression
       ↓
Career Category Prediction

The system generates the top career categories using the predicted class probabilities.

📈 Model Evaluation

The project calculates:

Accuracy

Measures the proportion of correctly classified samples.

Precision

Measures how many predicted samples of a class are actually members of that class.

Recall

Measures how many samples belonging to a class are correctly identified.

F1 Score

Combines precision and recall into a single metric.

Confusion Matrix

Shows the relationship between actual and predicted career categories.

Note: The current application evaluates the trained career classification model using the same feature matrix used during training. Therefore, the displayed evaluation metrics represent training-data performance and should not be interpreted as final unseen-data performance.

A future version can use a train-test split or cross-validation for more reliable evaluation.

🧪 Testing

The project contains unit tests for important modules.

Tested modules include:

Skill gap analysis
Job matching
Career classification
Model evaluation
Learning recommendations

⚠️ Limitations

The current system has some limitations:

Job matching primarily depends on textual similarity.
Skill detection depends on skills available in the job dataset.
Career classification depends on the available training data.
Learning recommendations are based on a predefined learning-resource mapping.
Current model evaluation uses training data rather than an independent test set.
